# CVND LSTMs Networks

These projects are part of the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.
They explore and implement the LSTM Networks using Pytorch through 2 main tasks:

### 1. Part-of-Speech Tagging

Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the category of a word from the words in
its surrounding context. Tagging parts of speech is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly and with high accuracy. It can help answer: what subject is someone talking about? Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like creating new sentences using a sequence of tags that make sense together and determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis. It is also used in information retrieval, and for word disambiguation (ex. determining when someone says right like the direction versus right like "that’s right!").

### 2. Character-Level LSTM in PyTorch

In this notebook, we build a character-level LSTM with PyTorch. The network will train character
by character on some text, then generate new text character by character. As an example,
the model will train on Anna Karenina. This model will be able to generate new text based on the text from the book! This network is based off of Andrej Karpathy’s post on RNNs and implementation in Torch.
